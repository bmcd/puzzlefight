#Puzzle Fight

[Play Here](http://puzzlefight.bradmcdermott.com)

##A competitive online puzzle game built with Node.js
* Created in JavaScript using the HTML5 Canvas.

* The back-end is a Node.js server running on Heroku.

##My first major project
* Created while learning JavaScript.

* Has been refactored numerous times as I have studied more about JavaScript best-practices.

##Gameplay
* Similar to tetris, the player drops blocks into a grid and tries to make them disappear, which sends them to the other player

* Land a circle adjacent to a block of the same color to destroy them, create combos to multiply the number of blocks sent over to your opponent

##Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* JQuery
* HTML5
* CSS
